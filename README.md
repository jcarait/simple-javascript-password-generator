# Simplified Javascript Password Generator

The purpose of this project is to create a password generator using what I've learnt in Week 03 through The Coding Bootcamp by University of Sydney and Trilogy Education.

## Pseudo code

Declare variable arrays for characters to be used in password
User selects desired password criteria
    Slider value is displayed and current value is stored as a variable
