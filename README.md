# Simplified Javascript Password Generator

The purpose of this project is to create a password generator using what I've learnt in Week 03 through The Coding Bootcamp by University of Sydney and Trilogy Education.

## Why build this project

We spend about 12.5 hours learning about Javascript in a classroom environment. However, this is not enough time to fully grasp Javascript fundamamentals and what it takes to work like a real-world developer.

Building something like this requires time and research to apply the knowledge -- it has also been a fun and enjoyable task.


## What I've learnt

- Different ways of working with arrays
- How to use and experiment with conditional statements like, if
- Object-oriented Javascript (OOJS)



### Disclaimer

This password generator is not recommended for real-world applications. Javascript 'random' is not truly random and can be predictable.
